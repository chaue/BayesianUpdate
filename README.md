These two notebooks explore the Bayesian framework for regression, first reviewing traditional regression before introducing
a Bayesian framework and deriving online updates for data streams. Most of the notation and theoretical setup is based 
on C. Bishop's book "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning". For a web friendly version, click [here](https://chauedwin.github.io/2021/03/21/onlinebayesian).
